# Introduction

RFC9334 presents the RATS architecture.
However, some parts of the specification contain errors that may lead to misinterpretations and even insecure implementations.
This document provides corrections to RFC9334.

# Corrections
{{Section 7.4 of -rfc9334}} has:

{:quote}
>  A conveyance protocol that provides authentication and integrity protection can be used to convey Evidence that is otherwise unprotected (e.g., not signed).

Using a conveyance protocol that provides authentication and integrity protection, such as TLS 1.3 {{-rfc8446}}, to convey Evidence that is otherwise unprotected (e.g., not signed) undermines all security of remote attestation. Essentially, this breaks up the chain up to the root of trust. Effectively, remote attestation provides no protection in this case and the security guarantees are limited to those of the conveyance protocol only. In order to benefit from remote attestation, it is recommended that Evidence MUST be protected using dedicated keys chaining back to the root of trust.
