1.  Introduction

   RFC9334 presents the RATS architecture.  However, some parts of the
   specification contain errors that may lead to misinterpretations and
   even insecure implementations.  This document provides corrections to
   RFC9334.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Corrections

   Section 7.4 of [RFC9334] has:

   |  A conveyance protocol that provides authentication and integrity
   |  protection can be used to convey Evidence that is otherwise
   |  unprotected (e.g., not signed).

   Using a conveyance protocol that provides authentication and
   integrity protection, such as TLS 1.3 [RFC8446], to convey Evidence
   that is otherwise unprotected (e.g., not signed) undermines all
   security of remote attestation.  Essentially, this breaks up the
   chain up to the root of trust.  Effectively, remote attestation
   provides no protection in this case and the security guarantees are
   limited to those of the conveyance protocol only.  In order to
   benefit from remote attestation, it is recommended that Evidence MUST
   be protected using dedicated keys chaining back to the root of trust.

4.  Security Considerations

   All of this document is about security considerations.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
